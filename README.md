# LightSpace

A tool to design daylight in VR.

By Roel De haene in order to obtain a master's degree of Civil Engineering: Architecture.



The tool is built in UE4.19 + VXGI (2.0) + RuntimeMeshComponent. It was built without any prior coding experience and thus rather messy.
Most of the code can be found in the MotionControllerPawn and BP_MotionController.

Take a look at a demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bu6GKGWBfU
